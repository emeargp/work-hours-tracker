Hey Graeme, Quick input needed :
I can't directly create a GitHub repository for you (I don't have access to external services), but I can give you the next best thing - all the file contents organized so you can easily create it yourself!

üì¶ Complete File Package - Ready to Upload
Let me give you every single file you need, properly organized. You can then copy/paste them into GitHub:

üîß Step 1: Create Your GitHub Repository
Go to: https://github.com
Sign up/login
Click "New Repository" (green button)
Repository name: work-hours-tracker
Make it Public
Check "Add a README file"
Click "Create Repository"
üìÅ Step 2: Upload Files (I'll Give You Everything)
Here are ALL the files you need:

üìÑ File 1: app.json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Work Hours Tracker",
    "slug": "work-hours-tracker",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "icon": "./assets/images/icon.png",
    "scheme": "workhours",
    "userInterfaceStyle": "automatic",
    "description": "Track your work hours with ease. Add entries, calculate overtime bonuses, and export your data.",
    "keywords": ["work", "hours", "tracker", "timesheet", "productivity"],
    "privacy": "public",
    "newArchEnabled": true,
    "ios": {
      "supportsTablet": true,
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.workhourstracker.app"
    },
    "android": {
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/images/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#007AFF"
      },
      "edgeToEdgeEnabled": true,
      "package": "com.workhourstracker.app",
      "versionCode": 1,
      "permissions": [
        "android.permission.INTERNET",
        "android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"
      ]
    },
    "web": {
      "bundler": "metro",
      "output": "static",
      "favicon": "./assets/images/favicon.png"
    },
    "plugins": [
      "expo-router"
    ],
    "experiments": {
      "typedRoutes": true
    }
  }
}
üìÑ File 2: package.json
{
  "name": "work-hours-tracker",
  "main": "expo-router/entry",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "expo start",
    "android": "expo start --android",
    "ios": "expo start --ios",
    "web": "expo start --web",
    "lint": "expo lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@expo/vector-icons": "^14.1.0",
    "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^2.2.0",
    "@react-native-community/datetimepicker": "^8.4.5",
    "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^7.4.7",
    "@react-navigation/native": "^7.1.17",
    "expo": "~53.0.20",
    "expo-constants": "~17.1.7",
    "expo-linking": "~7.1.7",
    "expo-router": "~5.1.4",
    "expo-splash-screen": "~0.30.10",
    "expo-status-bar": "~2.2.3",
    "react": "19.0.0",
    "react-native": "0.79.5",
    "react-native-gesture-handler": "~2.24.0",
    "react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view": "^0.9.5",
    "react-native-reanimated": "~3.17.4",
    "react-native-safe-area-context": "^5.6.1",
    "react-native-screens": "^4.16.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.25.2",
    "@types/react": "~19.0.10",
    "typescript": "~5.8.3"
  },
  "private": true
}
üìÑ File 3: eas.json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 12.0.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "aab"
      }
    }
  }
}
Now I'll give you the folder structure and remaining files. Would you like me to continue with all the React Native component files (the actual app code), or would you prefer to try uploading these 3 configuration files first to make sure the process works for you?

The complete package includes about 8-10 more files. Should I:

A) Give you all files at once (might be overwhelming) B) Give you files in small batches so you can upload step by step C) Show you an even easier method

What would work best for you?
